    Congratulations! We'd love to include your talk, <%= @proposal.title %>, at <%= @event.name %>.

    PLEASE KEEP THIS QUIET (no tweeting!) until your talk is announced as part of our program. We are expecting to have the whole program published by the end of this month <%= raise 'this month?' %> on our Program page -- we'll tweet about it from @rubykaigi once it's live. When you see your talk announced on our Program page, you can let everyone know that you'll be speaking!

    TO CONFIRM that you're still willing and able to present the above talk, please do two things:

    1. Click <%= @proposal.confirm_link %> and click the 'Confirm' button.

    2. Once you have confirmed, please use this link <%= raise 'fill think link' %> to book your complimentary Speaker's pass. If you already have purchased a ticket to RubyKaigi, you should still book your Speaker ticket, and then email 2016@rubykaigi.org to obtain a refund for your paid ticket.

    Please note: if your accepted talk has more than one speaker, each speaker needs his or her own complimentary speaker's pass.

    TO DECLINE (if you're no longer able to give this talk), please visit the <%= @proposal.confirm_link %>, and click the 'Withdraw Proposal' button.

    In the meantime, be sure to let us know if you have any questions. We're looking forward to seeing you there!

    The <%= @event.name %> Committee
<% end %>
